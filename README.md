# YouTube-Comment-Analysis-and-Text-Generation
This project is an exploration into the world of Natural Language Processing (NLP), focusing on YouTube comments. By analyzing the comments from a specific YouTube video, the project accomplishes two primary tasks:

Word Cloud Visualization: The comments are processed and visualized as a word cloud, highlighting the most frequently used words and phrases, thereby giving insight into the general sentiment and focus of the discussion.
Text Generation Model: Leveraging machine learning techniques, the project includes a text generation model trained on the comments. This model is capable of generating new text that resembles the style and content of the comments.
Features
Data Collection: Extracts comments from a specified YouTube video.
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses the text data for analysis.
Word Cloud Generation: Creates a visually engaging word cloud to represent the most prominent words in the comments.
Text Generation: Trains a machine learning model to generate text based on the patterns and styles found in the comments.
